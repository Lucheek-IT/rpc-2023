# Code of Conduct
RollyPolly Con is a convention for adults, so all attendees need to be at least 18 years old! Still, the convention is not focused on adult-only material, so please regulate sexually illicit and/or otherwise  “adults-only” material to specific channels.

RollyPolly Con aims to be a welcoming, comfortable, and fun convention for all of our attendees and presenters. As such&mdash; any form of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, fascism, or otherwise bigoted, exclusionist, or morally corrupt behavior or speech- including "ironic" examples and "jokes"- will not be tolerated. The "ban" option will be used swiftly, liberally, and absolutely, during the convention. If you're uncertain about the tastefulness of your comments, do not post it. This extends to Discord usernames, nicknames, status messages, profiles, and icons during the Convention.

No bullying or general antagonistic behavior toward other attendees. Try to stay positive, supportive, friendly, and respectful. This includes members of the opposite team. If you are having a problem with another attendee, please contact Staff in private to discuss the issue. Do not make passive-aggressive, or openly aggressive, comments inside the convention.

Avoid controversial and commonly upsetting (or "triggering") topics, and mark such topics with warnings and Discord's "Spoiler Tag" feature if necessary. If an attendee asks for a change of topic, please respect that wish without a fuss. We ask our attendees stay positive, on-topic, and focused on goodness. Constructive Critique should only be offered when solicited from a creator. Always listen to the direction of Lucheek, presenting panelists and streamers, and any staff.

Do not spam or “flood” channels, chats, ect. If you are not a RPC Artist or Vendor- please do not promote your own products, sales, sites or servers during the convention.

Failure to abide by the RollyPolly Con Code of Conduct will result in being banned from the convention server and loosing all attendance rewards! Lucheek and RollyPolly Con Staff retains the right to deny access to RollyPolly Con to anybody.
