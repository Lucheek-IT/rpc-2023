In addition to featured spots to promote their own personal store-fronts and commissions (if applicable) during the con- Envelope Vendors will submit artwork to Lucheek, who will turn the artwork into stickers! Envelope Members can buy these stickers during the convention, and have shipped all-together in their RollyPolly Con envelope! (When a con-goer doesn&#39;t have to pay for shipping for stickers from multiple sources, it can encourage them to buy more!) The creation, store-front, and shipping of the stickers is handled by Lucheek, Vendors don&#39;t have to worry about it. Best of all: 100% of the revenue from sticker sales will go to the Vendor, and the Vendor sets their own price for their stickers. (Any unsold stickers will be shipped to the Envelope Vendor after the convention, in their own Envelope- included as being part of a Vendor.) The “Envelope Vendor” program was designed with small content-creators in mind, who might not have access to create and fulfill physical products otherwise. Envelope Vendors will provide content for the digital Con-Book PDF, have dedicated channels in the server, and can promote personal store-fronts / commissions without offering any discount for Envelope Membership tiers.</p><p>Envelope Vendor opportunities are based on applications and approval by staff- they are not “first come, first serve.” Applications will close on <em>(TBD DATE)</em> or when we approve 6 vendors- whichever comes first. To apply, you will need to provide examples of your content, a US shipping address, and information about what products/services you offer or plan to offer (if any), and possibly ideas for your stickers.</p><p>If you have questions about the Envelope Vendor program, or wish to apply to be an Envelope Vendor, please contact <a href="mailto:austinvanderwilt@gmail.com">Lucheek at AUSTINVANDERWILT@GMAIL.COM</a>.</p><h2 id="artists-creators-free-world-wide" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#artists-creators-free-world-wide" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Artists / Creators (Free, World-Wide)</h2><p><small class="text-muted">Applications Open until <em>(TBD)</em> • Limited Spots: <em>TBD Amount</em> • Includes Digital Envelope Membership</small></p><p>Artists/Creators will have spots on the RollyPolly Con website to promote their personal store-fronts, commissions, and/or other digital products, as well as shared section of the Discord Server for promotion of these products and services. RollyPolly Con will also help promote their work on social media leading up to the convention. Unlike Envelope Vendors, no part of creation/fulfillment of Artist&#39;s products or services is handled by RollyPolly Con.</p><p>This is a free opportunity that includes the normally paid Digital Envelope Membership (and a discounted upgrade to Physical Envelope Membership for US-based Artists/Creators.) RollyPolly Con asks in return that Artists/Creators provide two things: An exclusive discount (or discount code, for automated web-shops) for Envelope Members during the convention&#39;s dates, and an exclusive contribution to our con-book. The exact amount/type of discount is free to be decided by our artists/creators, and does not need to be for every type of product/service purchase- we&#39;ll ask you give us an idea of what you&#39;re planning to offer in your application. Additionally, the con-book contribution doesn&#39;t need to be a full page or grand undertaking, but only something that is unique for the con-book and otherwise “new.”</p><p>These spots are application-based (not first-come-first-serve), and are limited. Non-Visual Artists (such as musicians, videographers, writers, and costumers) and general “Content Creators” are welcome to apply- as long as you have some product or service to offer and promote that you have created! (Re-Sale and Retail is not applicable.) Applications should include a sample of previous work, links to any relevant store-fronts or payment handles, and a brief description of your ideas for con-book contribution and discount, or other ideas.</p><p>If you have questions about the Artist/Creator program, or wish to apply to be an Artist/Creator, please contact <a href="mailto:austinvanderwilt@gmail.com">Lucheek at: AUSTINVANDERWILT@GMAIL.COM</a>.</p><h2 id="panelists-streamers-free-world-wide" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#panelists-streamers-free-world-wide" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Panelists / Streamers (Free, World-Wide)</h2><p><small class="text-muted">Applications Open until <em>(TBD)</em> • Limited Spots: <em>TBD Amount</em> • Includes Digital Envelope Membership</small></p><p>Panelists / Streamers will host events during RollyPolly Con, either on their own outside streaming platform(s), or through Discord channels (text or video) with-in the convention&#39;s sever.
