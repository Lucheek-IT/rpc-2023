Each team is made up of attendees, panelists, vendors, artists, and streamers. When you attend the convention you will be required to join a team! (Only staff is Team-Neutral!) Your team membership will be noted as a Discord Role, and can not be changed once selected. This event&#39;s teams are <span class="team-one">TEAM CRYTPIDS</span> and <span class="team-two">TEAM ROBOTS</span>!</p><p>Teams will earn points during the convention. Points can be earned by winning and participating in convention competitions and contests, and panel/stream game competitions. Points will be scaled to be proportional to team membership ratios, once the convention begins!</p><p>At the very end of the convention, the winning team will be announced. Every member of the winning team will win a discount on Envelope Memberships for the next RollyPolly Con, and to be part of the decision process of deciding the theme of the next RollyPolly Con! If you&#39;re a part of the winning team and a Physical Envelope Member, you&#39;ll also automatically receive a special, exclusive bonus sticker for free!</p><p>Remember! This is a friendly and playful competition meant to inspire participating with our con, and should never be taken too seriously, aggressively, or antagonistically. You must be courteous and respectful of both teams at all times, as per the Code of Conduct! Failure to do so might mean being removed from the convention, and loosing any winner&#39;s rewards.</p><h2 id="the-mascots" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-mascots" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Mascots</h2><p>Our mascots- <strong>Rolly-Pollyanna</strong> and <strong>Pill-Bugsy</strong>, are both home-bodies who prefer a cozy night in a burrow to big convention halls.
