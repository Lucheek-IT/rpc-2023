# RPC 2023 Website
This is a website powered by [VuePress v2](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/), which turns Markdown files into a pleasant website. 

It's easy to edit the content right here on Github. When changes are made, there's a little Action that runs to turn the markdown into HTML and publishes it to the site.
